# Plan Session

Read CLAUDE.md to get project context.

Then check the current state:
- docs/ROADMAP.md - for current and upcoming tasks
- docs/SESSION_LOG.md (last 3 entries) - for recent context
- docs/OVERVIEW.md - for system understanding
- docs/ADR.md - for relevant decisions

Create a session plan including:

1. **Session Goal**: ONE task from ROADMAP (pick from Now, or top of Next)
2. **Implementation Steps**: Concrete actions to complete the task
3. **Files Likely to Change**: Based on task scope
4. **Success Criteria**: How we'll know it's done
5. **Questions/Blockers**: Anything unclear before starting

Do NOT start implementing. Present the plan and wait for approval.
